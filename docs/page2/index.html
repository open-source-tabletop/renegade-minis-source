    <h2><a href="/2024/03/12/getting-weird-with-it.html">Getting weird with it</a></h2>
    <p>As if summoned by my last post, I found something that I can throw myself into. And it’s maybe a little weird.</p>

    <h2><a href="/2024/03/08/the-wrong-reasons.html">The wrong reasons</a></h2>
    <p>Last time I posted about making a miniature, and I was feeling very proud, very driven to keep going and achieve my goal. Of course immediately after that I entered a slump, unsure of what to do next I just picked up previous projects and kept plodding along. This is something I struggle with. On the one hand I believe in seeing things through, in pushing on even if I am feeling down on myself, it’s worked, it helps. On the other hand I tend to let that blind me to what I should be doing, putting off something I will enjoy because I have already decided to see something through, I struggle with changing my plans.</p>

    <h2><a href="/2024/02/28/about-making-stuff.html">About making stuff</a></h2>
    <p>For months now I have been trying to teach myself Blender to make stuff for tabletop games, there’s a far more personal version of this post where I talk about pursuing a dream I’ve had for 25 years, but this one is mostly just about rediscovering persistence.</p>

    <h2><a href="/2024/02/10/kicking-off-the-blog.html">Kicking off the blog</a></h2>
    <p>Hi, I’m Callie, the person doing all the minis but I want to actually write and have somewhere I can collect it all. Writing is not my strongest skill but I just can’t get past the idea of everything living on social media so this site, and this blog, will be where I’ll make my home. Doing my part to keep the internet small and weird.</p>
