				<p>As if summoned by my last post, I found something that I can throw myself into. And it’s maybe a little weird.</p>

<p>As per my last post I was making stuff and just not feeling it, and complaining about it, because that usually helps. Meanwhile on Mastodon a friend was trying to put together an entire wargame just 11 days before a convention (or something along those lines). Since I enjoyed making a miniature so much the answer now seems simple! Make some miniatures. In fact make a whole game, and release it before the end of March!</p>

<p>The idea is so great, I spent so long making my last mini and honestly I think I spend a lot of time fussing and overthinking. I am also aware that I am trying to be seen as already accomplished. I feel like I don’t belong and so I worry about making something less than amazing, even though I know that is an absurd position. I am allowed to be learning, I am allowed to make something “terrible” and to still be proud and love it all the same. So I’m going to do that.</p>

<p>I am going to make a miniatures skirmish game called Weirdos. 4-5 minis per side, just absolute freeform mini making, no plans, just weird models and weird rules. I will probably have somewhere between 3 and 6 hours to spend per mini so corners will be cut, decisions will be made for good or ill, and the game will be released and will be delightfully, willfully, terrible!</p>

<p>I’ve already started!</p>

<p>That’s some kind of slime guy and a hunched little alien dude. Why? I don’t know. But I like them, well I like the slime guy mostly I’m not so sure about the other one BUT THERE’S NO TIME TO DOUBT! MUST KEEP SCULPTING!</p>

<p>I’m having a blast.</p>
