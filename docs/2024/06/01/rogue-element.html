<p>Making a game in such a tight time frame is a lot of fun and for a minute there I felt like this game occupied every thought in my head. Having played and replayed it so many times for testing and balance I can definitely say it’s fun, I kept enjoying every new mission, and the number of close calls and tense moments that emerged from the rules really kept it fresh.</p>

<p>I’ve kept the game free, I know that every game people decide to play is already a commitment of time and energy to print, paint, and learn rules, so I wanted to lower that as much as I can. Maybe it will find a home with some people and maybe some will prefer to use the minis in other systems. I’m excited to see what people make of it and sincerely thank everyone who continues to support and encourage me - you are all so very awesome.</p>

<p>You can read more about the game itself in the <a href="/games/rogue-element/">Games section of the site</a>.</p>
