					<h1>An Unexpected Commission</h1>
					
				</header>
				<p>A month or so back (I think) I was chatting to a friend on Mastodon about looking to do some random free commissions to get some practice doing different kinds of things, this same motivation is what led to the <a href="/2024/04/28/custom-elf-sculpt.html">custom Elf Dullist</a> I did, and he had what seemed like a strange suggestion. I didn’t actually fully understand the nature of the mini he was after but it was a man, with the body of a large glow worm, wielding a chainsword, what made it interesting was that it was to honour an event organiser for blood bowl tournament called Thrudball with a custom coach miniature - so that was cool and I went ahead and had a great time doing it.</p>

<p>As it would turn out the mini was actually something the event organisers were looking to make available to everyone attending the tournament. I hadn’t really realised that at the start and felt bad I hadn’t put more work into the piece (though that’s absurd because actually I’m really pleased with how it came out), I am thrilled to see that it’s getting out there and the response was so positive. Honestly it was such a nice experience and Steven, the co-ordinator of the whole thing, was great to work with, and the mini was so out there that I was having so much fun the entire time sculpting it.</p>

<p>I hope I get a chance to work with them again, and really need to carve out a minute to get into Blood Bowl.</p>
