				</header>
				<p>For months now I have been trying to teach myself Blender to make stuff for tabletop games, there’s a far more personal version of this post where I talk about pursuing a dream I’ve had for 25 years, but this one is mostly just about rediscovering persistence.</p>

<p>I wont be making any waves if I suggest that simply sticking to something, week in, week out, and pushing yourself to keep moving forward even when it feels like it’s going nowhere has a tendency to eventually go somewhere. I’m not trying to teach anything. But it’s amazing how easy that lesson is to forget. And so this is just a post about confirming the obvious because sometimes we need to hear it and sometimes we need to say it.</p>

<p>I am ok at 3d modelling. I am better than when I started. I will be better than I am now. It will just take time.</p>

<p>So while I have not suddenly become a master sculptor, here’s something I am proud of, a miniature I designed, printed, and painted. I have called it a Frostheart Ravager, a fantasy miniature depicting a barbarian from a frozen land, using a particularly painful method of gaining some pretty impressive elemental abilities.</p>

<p>I’ve been working on loads of different things since I started and I enjoy seeing the progress I’ve been making. Most of it doesn’t seem worth writing a blog about but since I wanted to make miniatures, and this is the first “real” miniature I have made, it sort of feels worth celebrating.</p>

<p>I don’t always feel great about what I am doing. I have a lot of doubt. I have a lot of issues with self worth and motivation. But here it is, despite all that I am now right here, at this point. I’m on the path. That feels good.</p>

<p>What else can I achieve if I just keep doing it? What could you?</p>
