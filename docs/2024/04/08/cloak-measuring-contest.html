				<p>I had a little fun before getting started on my main project for this month after I got chatting to another 3D designer that goes by Mageworks. Feeling buoyed by my Junk Run experience I managed to talk myself into a Wizard-Off. I actually missed the deadline we set so this is my participation trophy post but it was such a nice experience and just great to get chatting with someone else getting stuck into this same hobby.</p>

<p>I am really pleased with it, it was about 8 hours work total. I would have liked to spend a little more but the aim of the game is “done” not “perfect”. I think my fabrics are getting a little better, and adding in little details is helping sell the overall effect. Hair is still a problem though, it’s just so hard to get it to look how I want, there has to be a better way.</p>

<p>What do you think? A great Wizzard or just a conjurer of cheap tricks? Either way it’s <a href="https://cults3d.com/en/3d-model/game/wizard-summoner">available now on Cults3D</a></p>
