				<p>Listen, there’s probably going to be a lot of spaceships going forward, they’re kinda my favourite thing.</p>

<h3 id="sentinel-squadron">Sentinel Squadron</h3>

<p>So this set of minis is actually made as a custom version of my game <a href="https://cadence.games/squadrons">Squadrons</a>, which I made with Cadence. It’s mostly the same game with new army lists which are based on my other game <a href="https://cadence.games/fracture">Fracture</a>. That’s a lot of custom games but that’s what’s so great about Cadence. I’m still working on the rules but they are on the Squadrons github, however they haven’t been finished or play tested yet so I’ll put something up once I do.</p>

<p>In this case I wanted some ships for my Sentinels factions, these might be understood as your typical space marines but really they represent all the elite, heavy armour, high tech, low body count type factions.</p>

<h3 id="strike-fighter">Strike Fighter</h3>

<div class="image fit">
    <img src="/images/frsk/sentinel-fighters.jpg" alt="Sentinel Strike Fighters" />
</div>

<p>I was aiming for a very blocky, sci-fi space plane, nothing too out of the ordinary. Just something that looks solid and dangerous. The heavy machine guns they are armed with are supplemented with a choice of rocket pods or plasma guns making them incredibly dangerous to even heavily armed targets.</p>

<h3 id="gunships">Gunships</h3>

<div class="image fit">
    <img src="/images/frsk/sentinel-gunship.jpg" alt="Sentinel Gunship" />
</div>

<p>Both the Gunship and the Destroyer below speak to the entire ethos of Sentinels in battle. They come heavily armed and heavily armoured, devastating enemy forces with their clear superiority - although they are often severely outnumbered. The Gunship is fairly slow and clumsy compared to most ships, though it makes up for this with its heavy machine gun turret which can handily take out small fighters trying to keep out of it’s main guns.</p>

<h3 id="destroyers">Destroyers</h3>

<div class="image fit">
    <img src="/images/frsk/sentinel-destroyers.jpg" alt="Sentinel Destroyers" />
</div>

<p>The Destroyer is a beefed up version of the gunship, sporting the same heavy armour and heavy machin gun turret. However each is also armyed with an Eradicator Lance or Fusion Bombs, capable of utterly devastating even the toughest targets in a single shot.</p>

<h3 id="lessons-learned">Lessons Learned</h3>

<p>Well this started out as a Sunday night bit of fun and ended up in several revisions to get here. And honestly I could go another round of revisions. Not that anything here is bad I just keep LEARNING MORE. While generally these are fine, the details and the overall shapes are actually proving very tricky to paint. It’s that same issue again of how much you need to inflate details that seem huge in the editor but disappear on the print. What this means is that these require you to paint every detail, they don’t drybrush well, they don’t wash well, because the detail is to slight. I will be tackling another faction soon no doubt which will be a great chance to see if I can learn those lessons.</p>
