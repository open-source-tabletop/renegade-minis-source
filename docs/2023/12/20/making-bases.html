					<h1>Making Bases</h1>
					
				</header>
				<p>There’s something about making bases for miniatures in Blender that I really enjoy, probably because it lets me focus on learning small new things and having a “finished” result in a short amount of time.</p>

<!-- more -->

<p>I’ve been working on some fantasy style bases because I realised I can make a voronoi texture that is like rough stones, cobbles, or something similar. This seems to work reasonably well as an anchored texture to effectively stamp a plate with the texture. To try and keep face counts as low as possible I made a small block big enough for the base sizes I would need that I can then intersect with a model for the base size I need to create a base. By just extruding the top of the base model you catch all the lovely texture as a “topper”.</p>

<p>Although I generally prefer Blender I actually modelled the bases in Fusion 360, mostly because I’m a stickler for the dimensions being right, and to the best of my knowledge there’s no way to set a taper angle of exactly 15 degrees on an extrude in Blender. Maybe there’s an add-on. Either way I now have them all imported into a file in my user library in Blender so they can be pulled into any file easily.</p>

<p>The results are good. Though very uniform. I might need to combine the effect with other elements to make it work better.</p>
