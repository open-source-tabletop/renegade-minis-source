				<p>“A century after humanity faced near extinction from global conflict and ecological collapse, the Nexogen Corporation rose as a beacon of hope, establishing Sanctuary Zones for those who pledged loyalty. Nexogen’s iron grip extended beyond Earth, orchestrating mining, agriculture, and manufacturing across the solar system. Despite promising a brighter future, Nexogen’s rule is marked by oppression and the exploitation of personal freedoms for corporate gain. Whispers of dissent have grown within the company, leading to a clandestine resistance that seeks to expose Nexogen’s atrocities and ignite the flames of rebellion.”</p>

<p><strong>A select group of operatives is now tasked with uncovering the dark truths hidden beneath the corporation’s facade and breaking its stranglehold on humanity.</strong></p>

<h2 id="about-the-game">About the Game</h2>

<p>Rogue Element is a tabletop miniatures game designed for solo play, but with co-op and asymmetric 2 player rules included. It is a Cyberpunk styled infiltration game that fits on small play areas and take around 45 minutes to play, with a built-in campaign system that lets you upgrade your operatives after each mission. Your team will use stealth to infiltrate various Nexogen facilities, taking down anyone that gets in their way as they secure their mission objectives. Of course, stealth only gets you so far, and your operatives are more than capable of shooting their way out if the situation calls for it.</p>

<h2 id="the-miniatures">The Miniatures</h2>

<p>The game includes 28 miniatures in 25mm scale, ranging from civilian scientists, to cyborgs, and even a large mech. These miniatures can be printed at 125% for use in other game systems and you can also make use of existing miniatures in your collection to represent your operatives and the enemies they will encounter. There is also a set of hex grid terrain boards included that the game is played on, these are best printed on an FDM printer due to their larger footprint.</p>

<h2 id="the-rules">The Rules</h2>

<p>The rules for Rogue Element are very light, focusing on quick gameplay and getting the “feel” of infiltration right. It has two main modes: in Stealth Mode you will be taking time to observe the movement of enemies and pushing your luck to complete actions without raising the alarm. Once your team is discovered the combat system is very streamlined which raises the pace of the action leading to exciting conclusions to your games.</p>

<h2 id="whats-next">What’s Next?</h2>

<p>I’m taking a short break from Rogue Element to give me time to absorb everything I have made and to come back in a month to do a range of updates. I will likely do the same thing I did with Junk Run and include a few additional miniatures or alterations if required as well as any errata in the rulebook. In the meantime things will be going in a new direction, the next project will not be a quick one, I have a project in mind that I want to invest heavily into that I think will be worth checking out. More on that to come.</p>
