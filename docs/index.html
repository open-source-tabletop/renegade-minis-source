    <h2><a href="/2024/06/10/an-unexpected-commission.html">An Unexpected Commission</a></h2>
    <p>A month or so back (I think) I was chatting to a friend on Mastodon about looking to do some random free commissions to get some practice doing different kinds of things, this same motivation is what led to the <a href="/2024/04/28/custom-elf-sculpt.html">custom Elf Dullist</a> I did, and he had what seemed like a strange suggestion. I didn’t actually fully understand the nature of the mini he was after but it was a man, with the body of a large glow worm, wielding a chainsword, what made it interesting was that it was to honour an event organiser for blood bowl tournament called Thrudball with a custom coach miniature - so that was cool and I went ahead and had a great time doing it.</p>

    <h2><a href="/2024/05/02/get-snekked.html">Get Snekked</a></h2>
    <p>Last month when I released Junk Run, the last miniature I made for it was the Iron Snake. Or, if you were to look at that miniature, the Iron Worm. In the short time I had it just failed to live up to the quality I had wanted - which says a lot because I’d set a nice friendly low bar for myself. Anyway the long and short of it is I made a new version while teaching myself a little bit about Geometry Nodes and here it is:</p>

    <h2><a href="/2024/04/28/custom-elf-sculpt.html">Custom Elf Sculpt</a></h2>
    <p>I recently offered to sculpt a mini for someone, really just for some practice, and the person that took me up on the offer had a character idea I really liked - an Elven Duelist with big guns and a taste for fashion. Ok the fashion part more than anything was where I knew I’d struggle.</p>

    <h2><a href="/2024/04/18/going-rogue.html">Going Rogue</a></h2>
    <p>Just quick post about where I’m at with my next game, which I am calling “Rogue Element”. I was originally aiming to do another game within a month but I have been enjoying this one so much I think I need to extend into May. It’s not that it’s such a big project, just that I want to finish off some things properly and clear my desk for June and going forward.</p>

    <h2><a href="/2024/04/08/cloak-measuring-contest.html">A Cloak Measuring Contest</a></h2>
    <p>I had a little fun before getting started on my main project for this month after I got chatting to another 3D designer that goes by Mageworks. Feeling buoyed by my Junk Run experience I managed to talk myself into a Wizard-Off. I actually missed the deadline we set so this is my participation trophy post but it was such a nice experience and just great to get chatting with someone else getting stuck into this same hobby.</p>

    <h2><a href="/2024/04/01/junk-run.html">Junk Run</a></h2>
    <p>Well, March is over, the game is released, that’s a huge success in my mind. I ended up calling the game Junk Run which I really like, there’s a slight B-Movie vibe through the whole thing that is more a reflection on my interests than a specifically planned theme. I even created and published a neat little PDF rulebook for the game. <a href="/games/junk-run/">I’ve written up a more detailed post in a new section of my site</a> - hopefully I can add more games here. In fact I would love to do one a month! Is that a good idea?</p>

    <h2><a href="/2024/03/20/theres-always-a-weirder-fish.html">There's always a weirder fish</a></h2>
    <p>I would like to direct your attention to the brilliant game <a href="https://caseyg.itch.io/space-weirdos">“Space Weirdos” by Casey G. on itch.io</a>, a skirmish game for about 5-10 minis of just some absolute space weirdos. It’s pretty cool. Also I just discovered it and boy does my game sound similar. Which is fine, except it’s just not sitting right with me since I found it. I want my game to be something else, something more unique I guess.</p>
