    <h2><a href="/2023/12/22/getting-wood.html">Getting Wood</a></h2>
    <p>I really thought that making wooden planks in Blender was going to be easy, just sculpt a little woodgrain into a box and it’s good to go. It really turned out to be more complicated than I could have expected. I should clarify I am talking about sculpting planks for the purpose of 3d printing, specifically for some Wild West buildings I need for playing tabletop games - meaning the texture has to be in the mesh and exaggerated enough to be painted easily, so most of the tutorials I found were not super helpful for it.</p>

    <h2><a href="/2023/12/20/making-bases.html">Making Bases</a></h2>
    <p>There’s something about making bases for miniatures in Blender that I really enjoy, probably because it lets me focus on learning small new things and having a “finished” result in a short amount of time.</p>

    <h2><a href="/2023/12/10/starting-somewhere.html">Starting Somewhere</a></h2>
    <p>Because you have to just pick somewhere to start I thought I should do a quick introduction, which I will probably expand upon at some point over in the About Me section.</p>

<p>I’m Callum, Renegade Minis is my little 3D modelling project, and this site is where I get to go on and on about whatever I’m doing. At the moment I think the majority of this will be around the topics of 3D printable miniatures, hence the name, but if other aspects creept in from time to time that’s ok too. Some of this will be “products” obviously, it would be great to make some money off this, but I think more often it will just be my ramblings. This whole endeavour is as much about me learning modelling for my own purposes.</p>
