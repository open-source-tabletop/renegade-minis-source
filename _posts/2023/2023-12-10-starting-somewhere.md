title: Starting Somewhere
---

Because you have to just pick somewhere to start I thought I should do a quick introduction, which I will probably expand upon at some point over in the About Me section.

I'm Callum, Renegade Minis is my little 3D modelling project, and this site is where I get to go on and on about whatever I'm doing. At the moment I think the majority of this will be around the topics of 3D printable miniatures, hence the name, but if other aspects creept in from time to time that's ok too. Some of this will be "products" obviously, it would be great to make some money off this, but I think more often it will just be my ramblings. This whole endeavour is as much about me learning modelling for my own purposes.

I have not enabled any kind of comments on here because I don't want the hassle of maintaining anything like that, this is built in Jekyll as a static site because that's the kind of self hating geek I am. Instead you'll find me on Mastodon at [https://mas.to/@pidgeon_pete](https://mas.to/@pidgeon_pete) or on Cults3D at [https://cults3d.com/en/users/renegade-minis/3d-models](https://cults3d.com/en/users/renegade-minis/3d-models).

Since I mentioned Cults3D you can grab some stuff already, mainly bases for your minis. Check out this set of "Necrotic Robot" style ones.
