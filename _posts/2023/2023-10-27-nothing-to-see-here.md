title: Nothing to see here
---

I have just started work sculpting a small range of minis in a 1960s-esque, pulp/noir style. Check out the first two agents:

I have a game in mind that will use the [Cadence System](https://cadence.games) for it's core rules which I'm calling "Nothing to See Here", a tabletop skirmish game where black suited government agents work to stop a reality corrupting cult from summoning their cosmic deity to earth. This would be bad enough if not for a criminal syndicate which aims to profit from the chaos at any cost. Of course you can use the minis for anything you like.

These two are basically complete, though a version with hats is going to be added, and a few more in different poses will be added. Of course the plan is to have a lot more variety than just mysterious g-men and I'll reveal what I can as it gets completed. There are some thoughts on bases and terrain that I have yet to make a final decision on but likely there will be something coming.

Hope to share more soon.
