title: Nothing to see here

I have just finished up a couple of 1960s inspired agents. I had ideas of a noir setting I wanted to explore and decided these would be an interesting place to start. Take a look.

This was an interesting sculpt for being quite 'mundane' models as this was the first time I was trying out a new method. I had previously thought that working on a model in a T-pose was the way to go, because a great many blender tutorials say so. However, those tutorials are aimed at a very different end result than what I am aiming for and involve a lot of work that I simply don't need to be doing.

Instead I'm approaching this more like a traditional mini sculpt. I create an armature out of basic shapes for each part of the body, getting the pose and proportions how I like it before blocking in a rough sculpt. Having something like the head as a separate object allows me to still have symmetry and I can break it only when I need to, which is typically late on. So this felt far more like "sculpting" than any of the modelling I'd done previously.

I'm also still struggling with proportion. So much on these looks very chunky when modelling, especially compared to something with realistic proportions. But when printed everything looks so tiny. I get the feeling that is a sense that will only develop through the doing.

### Lessons Learned

I want to try and always identify lessons I learned from each model. In this case I think the entire method qualifies so that's a big win. On the small scale stuff I'm getting a better feel for how big or small details need to be and how much detail is needed (or often, not needed since it will be tiny). Going into my next character I want a chance to mix fabric and hard objects to play more with how cloth will fold and pinch. Though I want to make some spaceships next so that's a good change of style.
