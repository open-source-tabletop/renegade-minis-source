title: Fractured Skies
---

The first set of ships for my game Fractured Skies will be releasing in the next few days on my [Gumroad Store](https://renegademinis.gumroad.com/) and [Cults3d profile](https://cults3d.com/en/users/renegade-minis/3d-models).

Fractured Skies is a squadron scale tabletop wargame based upon the [Squadrons](https://cadence.games/squadrons/) game I made in Cadence that is based in the same universe as the [Fracture](https://cadence.games/fracture) game. This first set of ships is for the Sentinels faction, elite and heavily armed strike forces that deploy from orbital carriers to engage in precision strikes to cripple enemy forces.

There are 3 ships included in this first wave: A Strike Fighter, Gunship, and Destroyer.

Strike Fighters leads the squadrons, quickly engaging with enemy forces to eliminate key ships. The Strike Fighter is a brutal ship, bringing heavy weapons and thick armour to the battlefield. While other ships may be faster or more agile, the sheer firepower of the Strike Fighter makes it a dangerous opponent.

 The Gunship is a heavily armed ship which provides the backbone to a Sentinel attack, devastating primary weapons and a heavy machine gun turret make them a threat from any position. Being able to target enemies from all angles makes up for this ships lack of mobility, enemies making an attack run often find themselves under assault as they retreat.

The Destroyer, a larger version of the Gunship which carries devastating weapons few can stand against: either the Eradicator Lance or a bay full of Fusion Bombs. Even one of these large ships on the battlefield is a threat that can't be ignored.

There are more factions to come, with the enigmatic Voidborn Corsairs up next. I can't wait to share this game and these models with everyone.
