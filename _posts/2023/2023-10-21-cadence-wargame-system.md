title: Cadence Wargame System
---

Since I'm here making minis, I wanted to tell you about another project I've been working on for a long time now that is intrinsically related: the Cadence Wargame System. It started out as my own simple home-brew wargame system several years ago, an interesting, if odd, D12 based system that was pretty fun. Basically there were lots of minis and games I 'kind of' wanted to play but either didn't want to invest in a whole new system or didn't like some aspect of the rules, and since I had a very small group to play with I threw together my own.

### From home-brew origins

Does that pun work? Only when you mispronounce it I think.

Getting more to the point-the home-brew has been through several major changes, near total rewrites, streamlining, and adapting to being a more flexible ruleset, until I decided that it should be released as an "open source" system. I believe in open source projects and community ownership of the things we love and have always believed wargaming needs to have that as well. Not just free but owned and driven by the community and beyond my control if people chose that. I haven't really promoted it to anyone yet because it was very much still undergoing testing but it's at a stage where I think people could play and enjoy it.

### What's the big idea?

While the current state of Cadence is something comparable to One Page Rules, primarily seeming like a proxy ruleset for bigger games, that was never the idea. The idea is more to have a game **engine**, something that you can use to create a new and unique game with whatever minis take your fancy in a very short time. Using Cadence like this, along with all the amazing 3d printable models out there, it is really quick to go from idea, to gathering all the minis you need, to a complete game that's entirely unique. 

It's a very liberating feeling. It's part of what made me want to make my own miniatures. I had an idea for a small celtic themed wargame with a setting that blended fantasy with celtic mythology of all different sorts. Unfortunately this one time I couldn't find any good kilted warriors to print to make my game and eventually had to abandon the idea. I might go back to it as my skills improve.

### Stuff You Can Play Now

If you're interested in some games, you can find a bunch of games I've already made in the system, mostly as a way to test and see how flexible it can really. There's a few games which will feel familiar, Squadrons for fans of dogfights in small ships or planes, Scraplands for vehicular racing mayhem, and Fracture for that solid sci-fi wargaming with all your grim and dark miniatures. But you'll also find a Halo tabletop game, a card based Wild West game, and a small scale skirmish that feels more like online shooter games than a typical tabletop with only 3 minis per side (but they respawn each round).

I'm planning a 10-15mm regiments game, an AVP/Space Hulk inspired game, and probably a fantasy skirmish game too. We'll see.

If you check it out, please feel free to get involved, if you're even remotely interested in making games you are welcome to join in making this system grow in all kinds of directions. It's all hosted on Github and can be used freely and commercially if you want.
