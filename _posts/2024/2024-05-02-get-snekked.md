title: Get Snekked

Last month when I released Junk Run, the last miniature I made for it was the Iron Snake. Or, if you were to look at that miniature, the Iron Worm. In the short time I had it just failed to live up to the quality I had wanted - which says a lot because I'd set a nice friendly low bar for myself. Anyway the long and short of it is I made a new version while teaching myself a little bit about Geometry Nodes and here it is:

As it turns out this doesn't actually require Geometry Nodes, I could have simply built up the first layer aligning the pieces to vertices on a cylinder then arrayed it along a curve, but it's a start in leveraging a lot of automated and procedural effects that will no doubt come in very handy as I learn more.

Now to try to print this thing...
