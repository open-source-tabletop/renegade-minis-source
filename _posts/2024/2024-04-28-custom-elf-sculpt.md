title: Custom Elf Sculpt
---

I recently offered to sculpt a mini for someone, really just for some practice, and the person that took me up on the offer had a character idea I really liked - an Elven Duelist with big guns and a taste for fashion. Ok the fashion part more than anything was where I knew I'd struggle.

Overall, I'm really pleased with the sculpt, I think I captured the strength of the character without losing the delicateness of her Elven nature. I'm always open to commissions but the process kind of terrifies me, especially when creating someone's character from their D&D games - because I know how attached people can be to those and getting it wrong feels like insulting them. I'm sure that can be filed in the overthinking it drawer.

I'm not sure how often random sculpts like this will come along but I look forward to sharing more.
