title: Kicking off the blog
---

Hey, it's me, Callum, the guy that makes the stuff on this site, and I want to actually write and have somewhere I can collect it all. Writing is not my strongest skill but I just can't get past the idea of everything living on social media so this site, and this blog, will be where I'll make my home. I think there's way too much emphasis on platforms these days and way too few small websites anyways.

I want to keep this post short because I don't feel much like rambling about nothing. I make 3d stuff, I paint minis, I play tabletop games, and somewhere in there I am trying to build something. Exactly what that is going to be I haven't decided yet, because I have no interest in pursuing what's popular, or what might bring me success. I want to follow my interests. I want to make things that I like and do it in a way that feels right, and sometimes even meaningful, to me.

I don't imagine I'll write often, but I'll try and keep it ticking over, that way I at least have some kind of log of my progress.

So if you found your way here, please check back from time to time, or follow me somewhere online, or in person, around town. I'll post what I'm doing and we can talk about it, and you can post what you're doing and we'll talk about it, and we'll all be happy geeky people happily geeking out about our hobby.
