title: Junk Run
---

Well, March is over, the game is released, that's a huge success in my mind. I ended up calling the game Junk Run which I really like, there's a slight B-Movie vibe through the whole thing that is more a reflection on my interests than a specifically planned theme. I even created and published a neat little PDF rulebook for the game. [I've written up a more detailed post in a new section of my site](/games/junk-run/) - hopefully I can add more games here. In fact I would love to do one a month! Is that a good idea?
