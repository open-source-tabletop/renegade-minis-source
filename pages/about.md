Hi, I'm Callie, aka Renegade Minis. I'm a Scottish artist making and self-publishing tabletop games. After 25 years of enjoying the wargaming and miniature painting hobby I decided it was time to make my own things. You will find information about miniatures and games I make here or you can follow me on either [Mastodon](https://mastodon.scot/@renegademinis) or [Instagram](https://www.instagram.com/renegade_minis_3d/).
