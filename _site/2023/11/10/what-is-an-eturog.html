<p>Are you on Mastodon? I highly recommend it. Thanks to the growing community of miniature painters we even now have mini painting competitions. Suffice to say I decided to have a little fun for it.</p>

<p>This model is something of a freeform design, just seeing what comes out as I sculpt and having fun. I ended up with this strange rock creature that I called an Eturog. I just kept piling it higher and higher with junk and enjoying the process. Don’t worry though, this little guy is of Troll descent, and the weight of a few boxes and bags means absolutely nothing to it. It makes for a slow but inevitable beast of burden.</p>

<p>It’s up on my Cults, should anyone want one.</p>

<h3 id="lessons-learned">Lessons Learned</h3>

<p>While this sculpt actually predates both my agents and spaceships, I learned a lot just making thing after thing. On a technical level learning how to split a mini to print in separate chunks was interesting, and will no doubt be really useful going forward. On a personal level, just doing the thing, just making something without worrying about it is a big step forward in my motivation struggle - something I am always trying to manage.</p>
