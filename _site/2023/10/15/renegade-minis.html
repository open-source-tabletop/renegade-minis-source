<p>It has long been a tradition of mine to create the first blog post for a website while the site itself is half finished (or less). It helps when building the site but it also gives me a chance to state my goals and introduce myself. So here goes.</p>

<h3 id="who-am-i">Who am I?</h3>

<p>I’m Callum. I am a long term nerd who has been making 3d models for just a little while now and simply wants to put them out there. Most for sale. I’d love to make a little money doing this and I’m not above admitting that but this endeavour has come from a lifelong wargaming and mini painting <del>passion</del> unhealthy obsession. Nearly 30 years of wargaming, mainly Warhammer Fantasy and 40k and everything around that, but never just Games Workshop games. I was always the one at my club looking for new games, wanting to see what else this hobby could be. And of course I always wanted to make my own but felt it was beyond me.</p>

<h3 id="what-is-renegade-minis">What is Renegade Minis?</h3>

<p>Like so many, during the pandemic, I dabbled in lots of new hobbies. I learned a small amount of 3d modelling for making low poly 3d games then continued with my normal life. In 2023 after getting into 3d printing it occurred to me that I was finally as close to my goal as I’d ever been and made a decision to put in the work learning Blender.</p>

<p>It was much harder than I expected, but at the same time I saw results. I made myself small accessories, eventually making odd models, until I realised maybe I could do something with this. It wouldn’t change the wargaming world but maybe I could at least add my small contribution to the whole. So that’s what this is. It’s making and selling 3d printable minis. It’s sharing game rules and ideas. It’s finally doing what I should have been doing when I was starting out.</p>

<p>It’s going to be fun. It might never amount to much and that’s absolutely ok with me. If I didn’t want this for myself I don’t think it would be a smart endeavour. I hope you find something in what I make that interests you. I hope you come and chat with me about making this hobby our own. Now, I just need to get this website finished.</p>
