    <h2><a href="/2023/11/04/fractured-skies.html">Fractured Skies</a></h2>
    <p>The first set of ships for my game Fractured Skies will be releasing in the next few days on my <a href="https://renegademinis.gumroad.com/">Gumroad Store</a> and <a href="https://cults3d.com/en/users/renegade-minis/3d-models">Cults3d profile</a>.</p>

<p>Fractured Skies is a squadron scale tabletop wargame based upon the <a href="https://cadence.games/squadrons/">Squadrons</a> game I made in Cadence that is based in the same universe as the <a href="https://cadence.games/fracture">Fracture</a> game. This first set of ships is for the Sentinels faction, elite and heavily armed strike forces that deploy from orbital carriers to engage in precision strikes to cripple enemy forces.</p>

    <p>I have just started work sculpting a small range of minis in a 1960s-esque, pulp/noir style. Check out the first two agents:</p>

    <h2><a href="/2023/10/21/cadence-wargame-system.html">Cadence Wargame System</a></h2>
    <p>Since I’m here making minis, I wanted to tell you about another project I’ve been working on for a long time now that is intrinsically related: the Cadence Wargame System. It started out as my own simple home-brew wargame system several years ago, an odd D12 based system that was pretty fun. Basically there were lots of minis and games I ‘kind of’ wanted to play but either didn’t want to invest in a whole new system or didn’t like some aspect of the rules, and since I had a very small group to play with I threw together my own.</p>

    <h2><a href="/2023/10/15/renegade-minis.html">Renegade Minis</a></h2>
    <p>Hello, welcome to my site/blog for a project I have decided to term “Renegade Minis” where I will be creating miniatures using 3d modelling and printing. I wanted to write something of an introduction here to say a little of what this is, what it might become, and about me. So here goes…</p>
